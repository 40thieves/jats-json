# jats-json

Utility for convert [JATS](http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/) XML documents to JSON.

Note: This is very much a WIP, that is similar to the Lens converter but with some modifications to be friendlier to my re-build of [Lens in React](https://github.com/40thieves/eyeglass). The code is pretty dirty, but I'm mostly just building out the test suite and will come back around to clean it up later :D
